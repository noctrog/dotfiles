# My personal dotfiles

This are the configs for my programs: neovim, zellij, starship, uv, ...

## Installation

Just run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noctrog/dotfiles .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles && ./install_environment.sh
```
The installation will set-up Rust and compile a couple of programs, it might take a few minutes.
